                                                        When I move out, does the law specify what I’m financially responsible for and what my landlord is financially responsible for?

                                                    Yes.  When you return possession of the rental property to your landlord, you are responsible for returning it in the same condition in which you received it LESS “ordinary wear and tear.” <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=CIV&amp;sectionNum=1950.5" target="_blank">Cal. Civ. Code § 1950.5(b)(2), (e)</a>.  In other words, the landlord must pay all costs associated with remedying “ordinary wear and tear.”  Unfortunately, “ordinary wear and tear” is not specified.  The discoloring of paint; wearing down of rugs; minor scratches and nicks on walls and countertops; etc. likely constitute “ordinary wear and tear,” for which the landlord is responsible.  A large gaping hole in the wall caused by a rowdy friend at a party or a cracked window caused by a toddler throwing a baseball through it likely do not constitute “ordinary wear and tear,” and the tenant will be responsible.  Reasonable people can disagree as to what does and does not constitute “ordinary wear and tear,” which in turn determines who is responsible for the repairs.  This is why tenants should always request a final inspection from the landlord before moving out.  (More below.)

                                                    Small Claims Court is a division of every California Superior Court where disputes between private litigants of up to $10,000.00 are decided.  Since lawyers are prohibited from representing litigants in Small Claims Court, the procedural and evidentiary rules which lawyers must normally follow in other Superior Court divisions are substantially more lenient.

                                                    Lawyers are prohibited from representing litigants in Small Claims Court.  However, you may seek advice from a lawyer prior to your trial on preparing for and presenting your case in Small Claims Court.  A lawyer or law firm can also assist you with the filing and service of your “Claim and Order to Go to Small Claims Court” (the document describing why you are entitled to recover money from the defendant).  You can also retain a lawyer to assist you with collecting your judgment.  In an appeal from a Small Claims Court judgment, an attorney may represent you.  However, only defendants may appeal judgments.  This means that if you are the plaintiff (the person filing the Claim and Order to Go to Small Claims Court) and you lose, you may not appeal the judgment.

                                                    The maximum an individual plaintiff may recover in Small Claims Court is $10,000.00.  Plaintiffs that are corporations, partnerships, governments, or other entities can recover no more than $5,000.00.  For claims above $2,500.00, plaintiffs are limited to one Small Cssss  laims Court lawsuit per calendar year.  There is no limit for claims less than $2,500.00.  “Claim splitting,” (dividing a case involving more than $10,000.00 into two separate lawsuits) to stay under the $10,000.00 limit is prohibited.  Claims of more than $10,000.00 but no more than $25,000.00 are known as “limited” civil cases.  Claims of more than $25,000.00 are known as “unlimited” civil cases.  Both limited and unlimited civil cases are heard in separate divisions of the Superior Court, and lawyers may appear on behalf of their clients in these cases.  Although plaintiffs can represent themselves in limited or unlimited civil cases (otherwise known as “in pro per” or “in propria persona” representation), the procedural and evidentiary rules are much more complex and pro per litigants often find themselves at a disadvantage against litigants represented by a lawyer.

                                            To file a Claim and Order to Go to Small Claims Court, you must pay a filing fee based on the amount of the claim: $30.00 if the claim is for $1,500.00 or less, $50.00 if the claim is for more than $1,500.00 but up to $5,000.00, and $75.00 if the claim is for more than $5,000.00.  However, if a plaintiff has filed more than twelve small claims lawsuits in California within the previous twelve months, the filing fee for each subsequent lawsuit is $100.00.  Other fees (summarized in a table at the end of this document) may apply.  The filing fee is paid to the Small Claims Court clerk.  The cost of hiring a process server (someone to hand-deliver a copy of the Claim and Order to Go to Small Claims Court to the defendant) varies by vendor but could run anywhere from $50.00 to $300.00.  If you prevail at your Small Claims Court trial, you can recover your case costs, including reasonable process server fees.

                                           There are three different ways to serve a defendant with a Claim and Order to Go to Small Claims Court in a small claims case: (1) personal service, (2)  substituted service, and (3) service by Certified Mail by the Court Clerk.

                                     A “server” must be at least eighteen years of age and not a party to the case (i.e., you cannot serve the Claim and Order to Go to Small Claims Court yourself).  The server can be either a friend, relative, or co-worker; or, as noted, you can hire a professional process server.  The local sheriff (or marshal if your county has one) can also deliver court documents.  You will have to pay the sheriff for this service unless you qualify for a fee waiver.

                                     For personal service, ask your server to personally “serve” (give) a copy of your court papers to the defendant or to the agent legally authorized to accept court papers for the defendant.  Tell the server to walk up to the defendant; say, “these are court papers”; and give the person copies of all the court papers.  If the person will not take the papers, the server can leave them near the person.  It does not matter if the person tears them up or throws them away.  The server must then fill out the Proof of Service (Small Claims) (Form SC-104), sign Page 2, and return the form to you for you to file.

                                     For substituted service, if the defendant is not at home or work when your server goes there, your server can give the court papers to a competent adult (at least eighteen) living at the defendant’s home; an adult who seems to be in charge where defendant usually works; or an adult who seems to be in charge where the person receives mail.  The server must also tell the person he or she is leaving the court papers with to give them to the defendant and write down the name of the person he or she gave the court papers to.  If the person will not give his or her name, your server must write down a physical description of the person who took the papers.  You must then mail another copy of the court papers by USPS First Class mail to the defendant at the same address where your server left the papers.  Fill out the Proof of Service (Small Claims) (Form SC-104) and sign Page 2.  The server MUST also fill out and sign the Proof of Mailing (Substituted Service) (Form SC-104A) for the second step of mailing a copy of the Claim and Order to Go to Small Claims Court.  Once the server fills out both forms, he or she must return the completed forms for you to file with the clerk.

                                     For service by Certified Mail by the Court Clerk, you can pay the court clerk to mail your Claim and Order to Go to Small Claims Court to the defendant by USPS Certified Mail.  While this can be a very convenient and inexpensive option, this type of service can also be very unreliable.  The court will probably not accept it and will make you serve again (with personal or substituted service) if the defendant or the defendant’s agent does not sign the certified mail receipt with his or her complete name, if the judge cannot read the signature on the certified mail receipt and cannot tell who signed it, or if someone else signs the receipt.
                                     After the server fills out and signs the Proof of Service, you must file it with the court at least five days before your Small Claims trial date.  Further information on serving the defendant is available at http://www.courts.ca.gov/9742.htm.

                                            The plaintiff always has the burden of proof.  Gather all the evidence that you believe is relevant to your case and that will convince the judge the defendant owes you money.  The easier you make it for the judge to understand your story, the better your odds of prevailing at trial.  Three items will be especially critical to proving your claim: (1) a factual summary of the events that led you to court, organized chronologically and not exceeding one page; (2) copies of any laws you intend to reference as a basis for your claims; and (3) a spreadsheet or other document calculating how you arrived at the number in your Claim and Order to Go to Small Claims Court.  Bring at least three copies of all these documents with you to court: one for you, one for the judge, and one for the mediator or the defendant (optional).  Also bring at least three copies of the filed Claim and Order to Go to Small Claims Court (Form SC-100), the filed Proof of Service (Form SC-104), and (if applicable) the filed Proof of Mailing (Substituted Service) (Form SC-104A).  Get a good night’s rest before your trial.  Wear a suit to court.  This will show the judge (and the defendant) you are taking this matter seriously.  Plan on arriving at the courtroom at least thirty minutes before your trial.  Since it could take up to half an hour to wait in line and get through security, plan on physically entering the courthouse at least one hour before your trial.  You do not want to be rushed on your trial date.  Further information on preparing for trial is available at <a href="http://www.courts.ca.gov/1013.htm"> http://www.courts.ca.gov/1013.htm.</a>

                                           After entering the courthouse, head to your assigned courtroom.  This will be listed on the Claim and Order to Go to Small Claims Court.  You will likely find many other litigants waiting outside the courtroom.  Most courts will have a calendar placed directly outside of the courtroom with a list of the cases the judge will hear that day.  Note the line number associated with your lawsuit.  Once the doors open, check in with the clerk.  The clerk will ask which line you are on and whether you are the plaintiff or the defendant.  After you check in, take a seat and wait for your matter to be called.  The clerk will go over some of the rules of the court and, assuming both sides are present, will ask you both to step outside and share your evidence with each other.  After you have done so, enter the courtroom and wait until your case is called.  When it is, approach the table in front of the judge.  (The plaintiff usually sits or stands on the left-hand side but go wherever you are instructed.)  The judge may ask the parties if they want to attempt mediation or order the parties to attempt mediation.  Courts often have onsite mediators to assist litigants free of charge.  Mediation is always a good idea.  If you come to an agreement at mediation, you do not need to present your case to the judge.  The mediator can assist in memorializing the terms of any agreement and then present it to the judge.  The judge will then (1) enter it into the record and (2) set a “compliance hearing” at a later date so that if the defendant fails to comply with the agreement, the plaintiff can return to court and request an immediate judgement.  If you do not come to an agreement at mediation, you can simply return to the court to present your case.  The plaintiff goes first and, as noted, has the burden of proving the case.  Relying on the documents you prepared, succinctly explain your case to the judge.  Always be respectful; never interrupt the judge.  The defendant will have a chance to present his or her side and challenge any evidence you may present with his or her own.  In most cases, the judge will take the matter “under submission,” i.e., return to his or her chambers to review all the evidence and arguments presented and issue a written decision later.  Usually, a decision will be mailed to the parties within two to four weeks of the trial date.  Further information on your trial is available at http://www.courts.ca.gov/1119.htm.

                                           Unfortunately, there is no absolute guarantee that once you receive a favorable judgment, the defendant will actually the money owed to you.  Initially, the defendant has a thirty-day window from a judgment in your favor to appeal.  Thus, you must wait until this period has expired before taking any further action.  Once it has, you can attempt to collect by either referring the matter to a collection agency or filing a lien on the defendant’s real property.  Both have their advantages and disadvantages.  Collection agencies are more immediate but could cost you a larger fee.  Liens have a lower cost, but you may only recover if the real property is sold.  You would be listed as a creditor and that debt would have to be paid in order for the sale to proceed.  However, because the owner may never sell the property, it is difficult to determine when and if you would ever recover the money owed.  Further information on collecting your judgment is available at http://www.courts.ca.gov/1014.htm.
