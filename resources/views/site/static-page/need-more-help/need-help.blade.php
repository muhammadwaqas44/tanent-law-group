                <p class="body_p">While this website provides renters with the tools and information they need to recover their security deposits, sometimes issues with a current or former landlord extend beyond just the wrongful withholding of a security deposit.  For example, if you were forced out of a rent-controlled apartment without legal justification, harassed, suffered a bodily injury or physical illness caused by your landlord or rental unit, or were otherwise subject to egregious landlord behavior, talk to a qualified tenant rights attorney about your case.<br>
