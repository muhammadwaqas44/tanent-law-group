                'title' => '<strong>II.  Recovering Your Security Deposit</strong>',
                'description' => '<p>Ideally, a tenant&rsquo;s strategy to recover his or her entire security deposit begins at the time the tenant notifies the landlord of the termination of the tenancy.&nbsp; A tenant&rsquo;s strategy will more likely begin after the tenant has moved out of the rental unit and after the landlord has failed to return all of the tenant&rsquo;s security deposit within twenty-one days.&nbsp; Fortunately, the template lettersavailable in this Security Deposit Toolkitand on our website can be edited to account for either scenario.</p>
<p>Summarized below are steps you can take to put yourself in the best position possible to recover your security deposit, keeping in mind that many tenants begin this process at Step 5.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Prepare a move out letter notifying your landlord of your intention to terminate your tenancy and your request for an initial inspection of the rental unit, and provide a mailing address for your security deposit.</li>
<li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Appear for the initial inspection.</li>
<li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Clean the rental unit and address any identified repairs, ensuring you return it to the landlord in the same condition you received it LESS ordinary wear and tear.</li>
<li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Return the keys, garage door opener, and any other applicable items on or before the date your tenancy terminates.</li>
<li><strong>Step 5:</strong> If your landlord has not returned your security deposit within twenty-one days, send a second letter citing the law, informing the landlord of the statutory penalty of twice the amount of the security deposit withheld in bad faith, and providing a date certain by which the landlord must return the remaining portion of security deposit to avoid further action.</li>
<li><strong>Step 6:</strong> If your landlord does not return the balance of your security deposit by the date stated in your letter, decide whether the amount withheld justifies the time, resources, and mental and emotional energy needed to pursuethis matter in Small Claims Court.</li>
<li><strong>Step 7:</strong> If you believe it does, prepare and file a Plaintiff&rsquo;s Claim and ORDER to Go To Small Claims Court, serve a copy on the landlord, file the proof of service, and prepare for and attend your Small Claims Court trial.</li>
<li><strong>Step 8:</strong> Inform the landlord you reserve the right to pursue any and all legal means at your disposal to pay the court-ordered judgment, to report him or her to the Better Business Bureau, and/or to share your negative experience with other renters on social media.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A. Step 1: Preparing Your Move Out Letter and Requesting an Initial Inspection.</strong></p>
<p>Once you have decided to terminate your tenancy, you will need to provide your landlord written notice.&nbsp; To do so, you can either customize one of the two Word documents appearing in this Security Deposit Toolkit as Exhibit A1 (if you are moving out due to one or more issues with your landlord, rental unit, or tenancy) or Exhibit A2 (if you are not moving out due to any issues with your landlord, rental unit, or tenancy), as appropriate; or use the autogenerated letter option online at <a href="https://mysecuritydeposit.com/">http://MySecurityDeposit.com</a>, selecting &ldquo;Notice of Termination of Tenancy Due to One or More Issues with Landlord, Rental Unit, or Tenancy&rdquo; or &ldquo;Notice of Termination of Tenancy Not Due to One or More Issues with Landlord, Rental Unit, or Tenancy,&rdquo; as appropriate. &nbsp;This letter informs your landlord that you will be ending your tenancy, (if applicable) cites the landlord&rsquo;s actions or omissions that have caused you to end your tenancy, requests an initial inspection of the rental unit within two weeks of the date of termination, proposes certain dates and times for the inspection, and provides a mailing address for your security deposit.</p>
<p>If you are on a month-to-month tenancy and the reason you are moving out is entirely unrelated to any of your landlord&rsquo;s actions or omissions, you should give at least one month&rsquo;s notice&mdash;preferably longer as a courtesy to allow your landlord to find a new tenant.&nbsp; Similarly, if you are nearing the end of your lease term and the reason you are moving out is entirely unrelated to any of your landlord&rsquo;s actions or omissions, you must provide the amount of notice set forth in your lease.</p>
<p>If, however, you are moving out due to your landlord&rsquo;s actions or omissions (such as the landlord&rsquo;s verbal or physical harassment, the landlord&rsquo;s failure to make repairs following requests by you to do so, or the landlord&rsquo;s failure to</p>
<p>address any other issue affecting the health and/or safety of you and anyone else you live with at the rental unit), you do not need to give the notice required under the lease.&nbsp; While the law does not force a tenant to continue living at a rental unit that is endangering the tenant&rsquo;s health and/or safety, be prepared for the landlord to disagree.&nbsp; Even in this scenario, it is best to provide the landlord with at least one month&rsquo;s notice if the tenancy is month-to-month.&nbsp; If, however, the tenancy is subject to a fixed term and you are vacating before that lease term is up, be prepared for your landlord to argue he or she is due all rent through the end of the lease term.&nbsp; If you are in this situation, consult with a tenant rights attorney to discuss your rights and a recommended strategy.&nbsp; (See Chapter V, entitled &ldquo;Getting Additional Help.&rdquo;)</p>
<p>The address for any notices relating to your tenancy may be specified in your written lease.&nbsp; If it is not, or if you have an oral lease with your landlord, use the address to which you have been mailing or dropping off your rent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Once the letter is finalized,print it, sign it, scan it, and mail it via USPS Certified Mail (or another courier with a tracking option) to the address specified in your lease or to the address to which you have been paying rent.</p>
<p>If you have the landlord&rsquo;s email address, email a digital copy of the scanned letter to your landlord.&nbsp; In the subject line, enter &ldquo;Termination of Tenancy - [enter full address of rental property]&rdquo; and in the body, enter &ldquo;Dear Mr./Ms. Landlord, Find attached correspondence regarding the termination of my tenancy at the above-referenced address.&nbsp; Regards, Your Name.&rdquo;&nbsp; You can customize the language and tone of your message based on the nature of your relationship with your landlord.&nbsp; What is most important is that the letter is attached.&nbsp; If your email software has this feature, request a send receipt and a read receipt, which would prove that your message was sent and read, respectively.&nbsp; Your landlord may elect not to indicate whether the message was read, which is why you are also mailing a copy of the letter.</p>
<p>If your landlord does not confirm a date and time for the initial inspection, follow up with a call, email, and/or text on the date two weeks prior to your move out.&nbsp; If your landlord still refuses to conduct an initial inspection, he or she is already in violation of the law.<a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=CIV&sectionNum=1950.5">See Cal. Civ. Code § 1950.5(f)(1).</a></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; B. Step 2: Appearing for the Initial Inspection.</strong></p>
<p>After your landlord has confirmed the date and time of the initial inspection, you should do a few things to prepare.&nbsp; First, since you will probably not be fully packed up at this time, be sure you can at least provide as much visual access to walls and floors as possible.&nbsp; For this reason, it is in your interest to have as much of your personal property packed up and moved out as possible at the time of the inspection.&nbsp; You should have access to a camera and,ideally, ask someone who is not also a roommate to be there as your witness.&nbsp; You cannot audio-record or video-record the inspection unless you have the landlord&rsquo;s or the landlord&rsquo;s agent&rsquo;s permission.Recording a confidential communication without the other person’s consent is a misdemeanor in California.  See <a href="" target="_blank">Cal. Penal Code § 632(a)</a>.</p>
<p>When the landlord or the landlord&rsquo;s agent arrives, carefully walk through all areas of the rental unit.&nbsp; When the landlord or the landlord&rsquo;s agent identifies an area that needs to be fixed, take a photo.&nbsp; Do this until you have inspected the entire rental unit.&nbsp; If you disagree that you are responsible for any of the repairs, you can remind the landlord or the landlord&rsquo;s agent that you are responsible only for returning the rental unit to the landlord in the condition in which you received it at the start of the tenancy less any ordinary wear and tear.</p>
<p>At the conclusion of the inspection, the landlord or the landlord&rsquo;s agent must provide you with an itemized statement specifying repairs or cleanings proposed to be the basis of any deductions from your security deposit.&nbsp; This statement must include certain language from California Civil Code section 1950.5.&nbsp; If the landlord or the landlord&rsquo;s agent fails to provide you with this document or if the document does not include certain language from California Civil Code section 1950.5, he or she is in violation of the law.See <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=CIV&sectionNum=1950.5" target="_blank">§ 1950.5(f)(2)</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, be sure to schedule a time and place for you to return the keys, garage door opener, and any other applicable items to your landlord on or before the date your tenancy terminates.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; C. Step 3: Cleaning the Rental Unit and Addressing Any Identified Repairs.</strong></p>
<p>The itemized statement you received at the conclusion of the initial inspection should be your checklist for repairs to the rental unit.&nbsp; As noted in Chapter I, the discoloring of paint; wearing down of rugs; minor scratches and nicks on walls and countertops; etc. likely constitute &ldquo;ordinary wear and tear,&rdquo; for which the landlord is financially responsible.&nbsp; Steam-cleaning carpeting is probably the financial responsibility of the tenant if the carpeting had been steam-cleaned prior to the tenant moving in.&nbsp; A large gaping hole in the wall caused by a rowdy friend at a party or a broken window caused by a toddler throwing a baseball through it likely do not constitute &ldquo;ordinary wear and tear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Notwithstanding any disagreements you raised during the initial inspection about who was responsible for what, if your landlord has nonetheless included on the itemized statement any repairsthat you believe fall within the bounds of &ldquo;ordinary wear and tear&rdquo; and that are therefore the landlord&rsquo;s financial responsibility, inform the landlord, in writing (i.e., using the same method for your notice of termination of tenancy), why you believe this is the case and indicate that you will not be addressing the identified repairs.&nbsp; While you should be prepared for the landlord to deduct costs for these repairs from your security deposit anyway, know that you will have an opportunity to challenge any such repairs in the future, and this writing will serve as evidence that your landlord was on notice of your disagreement with the repairs your landlord identified.</p>
<p>You have until the date you move out to address all repairs.&nbsp; It is entirely up to you whether you deem it worth your time, energy, and resources to address the identified repairs yourself, as opposed to enlisting the assistance of a friend, family member, or hired professional.&nbsp; The principal benefit of hiring a professional versus letting the landlord hire a professional is that it allows you to choose the vendor and you will probably be more inclined than the landlord to find a cost-effective vendor.</p>
<p><strong>D.Step 4: Returning the Keys, Garage Door Opener, and Any Other Applicable Items on or Before the Date Your Tenancy Terminates.</strong></p>
<p>Once you have addressed the identified repairs in the previous step, take photos to memorialize your work.&nbsp; After you have moved all of your personal property out of the rental unit and left it in the same condition it was in at the start of your tenancy less ordinary wear and tear, you are ready to return your keys, garage door opener (if applicable), and any other applicable items to your landlord.&nbsp; Do so at the time and place agreed upon after the initial inspection.&nbsp; If you did not agree upon a time and place for the return of these materials at that time, contact your landlord (preferably via email or text so that you have a written record, but if time is of the essence, you can call) to coordinate the drop-off.</p>
<p><strong>E. Step 5: If Your Landlord Has Not Returned Your Security Deposit Within Twenty-One Days, Sending a Second Letter.</strong></p>
<p>For many renters, this is the first step in the process of pursuing their security deposit.&nbsp; That is totally fine.&nbsp; If this is your situation, you may not have the benefit of having documented all your interactions with your landlord, having forced your landlord to provide you with an itemized statement of repairs, and having made good faith efforts to address any such repairs.&nbsp; Nonetheless, your landlord has no right to withhold any portion of your security deposit if you returned the rental unit in the same condition in which you received it, less ordinary wear and tear, assuming you had no other financial obligations (e.g., unpaid rent) to the landlord.</p>
<p>Because the law requires a landlord to &ldquo;furnish&rdquo; a tenant with the security deposit or an itemized statement within twenty-one calendar days (i.e., three weeks), a landlord is technically in violation of the law on the twenty-second day.&nbsp; Nonetheless, because your landlord may not be aware of this nuance in the law, you should wait until at least two to three business days after the twenty-first day to allow for anything mailed on day twenty-one to be received.</p>
<p>Assuming you received nothing two to three business days after the twenty-first day or you received an itemized statement withholding costs for repairs beyond ordinary wear and tear, it is time to inform the landlord he or she is in violation of the law.&nbsp; To do so, either customize the Word document appearing in this Security Deposit Toolkit as Exhibit B, entitled &ldquo;Sample Security Deposit Demand Letter to Landlord,&rdquo; or use the autogenerated letter option online at <a href="http://MySecurityDeposit.com">http://MySecurityDeposit.com</a>, selecting &ldquo;Demand Letter Requesting Return of Security Deposit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again, the address for any notices relating to your tenancy may be specified in your written lease.&nbsp; If it is not, or if you have an oral lease with your landlord, use the address to which you had mailed or dropped off your rent.</p>
<p>Once the letter is finalized, print it, sign it, scan it, and mail it via USPS Certified Mail (or another courier with a tracking option) to the address specified in your lease or to the address to which you have been paying rent.</p>
<p>If you have the landlord&rsquo;s email address, email a digital copy of the scanned letter to your landlord.&nbsp; In the subject line, enter &ldquo;Return of Security Deposit - [enter full address of rental property]&rdquo; and in the body, enter &ldquo;Dear Mr./Ms. Landlord, Find attached correspondence regarding your failure to return my security deposit.&nbsp; Regards, Your Name.&rdquo;&nbsp; Feel free to customize the language and tone of the message.&nbsp; What is most important is that the letter is attached.&nbsp; If your email software has this feature, request a send receipt and a read receipt, which would prove that your message was sent and read, respectively.&nbsp; Your landlord may elect not to indicate whether the message was read, which is why you are also mailing a copy of the letter.</p>
<p><strong>F. Step 6: If Your Landlord Does Not Return The Balance Of Your Security Deposit By The Date Stated In Your Letter, Decide Whether to Pursue This Matter In Small Claims Court.</strong></p>
<p>You have now put your landlord on notice that he or she is in violation of the law and that you now have no choice but to initiate formal legal proceedings.&nbsp; Assuming the amount at issue is $10,000.00 or less, that means filing a claim in Small Claims Court.&nbsp; The question now is whether you believe the potential As noted in the Disclaimer, following this process does not guarantee you will recover your security deposit recovery of your security deposit is worth the time, cost, and mental and emotional energy.</p>
<div><strong>Time.</strong>&nbsp; At this point, you will have already spent a significant amount of time and energy on leaving your rental unit in the same condition in which you found it less ordinary wear and tear.&nbsp; For the next steps, you can expect to spend approximately one hour preparing your Plaintiff&rsquo;s Claim and ORDER to Go To Small Claims Court, one to three trips to the courthouse (one trip if you use a small claims court filing and service vendor; two to three times if you wish to file Plaintiff&rsquo;s Claim and ORDER to Go To Small Claims Court and Proof of Service (if applicable) yourself plus a trip for your Small Claims trial), half an hour to prepare the certified mailing, at least one to two hours preparing for your Small Claims Trial, and up to a full day for your Small Claims Trial.&nbsp; This could mean anywhere from a day and a half to two and a half days of your time.</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Cost.</strong>To file a Claim and Order to Go to Small Claims Court, you must pay a filing fee based on the amount of the claim: $30.00 if the claim is for $1,500.00 or less, $50.00 if the claim is for more than $1,500.00 but up to $5,000.00, and $75.00 if the claim is for more than $5,000.00.&nbsp; If you serve your landlord by Certified Mail, the cost of postage is approximately $15.00.&nbsp; Small claims filing and service vendors may charge anywhere from $50.00 to $200.00 or more for their services.&nbsp; You should also include the costs of transportation to and from the courthouse.&nbsp; In sum, the cost is likely to be between $50.00 and $300.00.</p>
<p><strong>Mental and Emotional Energy.&nbsp;</strong> Appearing in court&mdash;even when you believe you are in the right&mdash;can be stressful.&nbsp; This consideration is impossible to quantify and unique to each person but is definitely worth considering.&nbsp; You should also keep in mind that a lawsuit&mdash;even a claim in Small Claims Court&mdash;is a public record.&nbsp; Moving forward, whenever you are asked whether you have ever been a party to a lawsuit, your answer will be &ldquo;yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Assuming you are ready to move forward, the next chapter will discuss how to prepare for and what to expect when you attend your Small Claims Court trial.</p>'

                'description' => '<p>The process of preparing and filing a claim in Small Claims Court is relatively simple and straightforward.&nbsp; This is by design.&nbsp; Small Claims Court is a division of every California Superior Court where disputes between private litigants of up to $10,000.00 are decided.&nbsp; Since lawyers are prohibited from representing litigants in Small Claims Court, the procedural and evidentiary rules which lawyers must normally follow in other Superior Court divisions are substantially more lenient.&nbsp; With a relatively modest investment of time, resources, and energy, self-represented litigants can have their day in court.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">A.&nbsp; Preparing Plaintiff&rsquo;s Claim and ORDER to Go To Small Claims Court</p>
<p>A plaintiff must download, complete, sign, date, and file the Claim and Order to Go to Small Claims Court (<a href="http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/sc100.pdf">Form SC-100</a>).&nbsp; Included in this Security Deposit Toolkitas Exhibit Cis a sample Claim and Order to Go to Small Claims Court you can use as a template.&nbsp; Here is a step-by-step guide to filling it out:</p>
<ul>
<li>Page 1.&nbsp; Under &ldquo;Fill in court name and address,&rdquo; enter the name of the county in which the Court is located and the Court&rsquo;s address.&nbsp; The proper court is the one in which either your former rental unit is located or in which your landlord resides (if different). &nbsp;The court&rsquo;s address appears on the on the court&rsquo;s website.</li>
<li>Page 2, Item 1.&nbsp; Under &ldquo;The plaintiff (the person, business, or public entity that is suing) is,&rdquo; enter your name, phone number (remember this is a public record, so you may not wish to enter your cell phone number), street address, and mailing address (if different).&nbsp; If there is more than one plaintiff, enter the same information under &ldquo;If more than one plaintiff, list next plaintiff here.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Page 2, Item 2.&nbsp; Under &ldquo;The defendant(the person, business, or public entity being sued) is,&rdquo; enter your landlord&rsquo;s name, phone number, street address, and mailing address (if different).&nbsp; If your landlord is a corporation or limited liability company, enter the person or agent authorized for service of process.&nbsp; You can find this information is available on the California Secretary of State website <a href="https://businesssearch.sos.ca.gov/" aria-invalid="true">here</a>.</li>
<li>Page 2, Item 3.&nbsp; Enter the total amount the landlord owes you.</li>
<li>Page 2, Item 3(a).&nbsp; Enter one or two sentences summarizing why your landlord owes you money, e.g., &ldquo;Defendant, my former landlord, withheld my security deposit in bad faith. I requested an initial inspection, which was not granted.&nbsp; I have provided my landlord with my mailing address and sent a demand for the amount due.&rdquo;&nbsp; Next to &ldquo;When did this happen? (Date),&rdquo; enter the date twenty-one days from the date you returned possession of your rental unit.</li>
<li>Page 2, Item 3(b).&nbsp; Leave blank.</li>
<li>Page 2, Item 3(c).&nbsp; Explain how you calculate the money owed to you, e.g., &ldquo;Total due: $1,500.00 (security deposit) + $3,000.00 (twice the amount withheld in bad faith; see Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 1950.5(l)) + $49.00 (fee paid to third party for information pertaining to Cal. security deposit law) = $4,549.00.&rdquo;&nbsp; Included in this Security Deposit Toolkit as Exhibit D is a Security Deposit Expense Calculator you can use to ensure your math is correct.</li>
<li>Page 3, Item 4.&nbsp; Because you have already sent the Security Deposit Demand Letter, check the box next to &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Page 3, Item 5.&nbsp; Check the box next to &ldquo;(a.).&rdquo;</li>
<li>Page 3, Item 6.&nbsp; If you are suing in the county in which the rental property is located, enter the zip code of the rental property.&nbsp; If you are suing in the county in which your landlord lives, enter the zip code of your landlord&rsquo;s mailing address.</li>
<li>Page 3, Item 7.&nbsp; Check the box next to &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Page 3, Item 8.&nbsp; Check the box next to &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Page 3, Item 9.&nbsp; Check the box next to &ldquo;No,&rdquo; unless you have filed more than twelve other small claims complaints within the last twelve months in California.</li>
<li>Page 3, Item 10.&nbsp; Check the box next to &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; if the total you entered in Item 3(c) is more than $2,500.00; otherwise, check the box next to &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Page 3, Item 11.&nbsp; Review all the information you entered to ensure it is correct, as you are signing under penalty of perjury.&nbsp; Then enter the date and your printed name.&nbsp; Print the document and sign it.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>B.&nbsp; Filing Plaintiff&rsquo;s Claim and ORDER to Go To Small Claims Court</strong></p>
<p>You have two options for this: (1) you can file the Plaintiff&rsquo;s Claim and ORDER to Go to Small Claims Court yourself, or (2) you can hire a vendor to file this on your behalf.</p>
<p><strong>Filing Yourself.&nbsp;</strong> If you wish to file the Plaintiff&rsquo;s Claim and ORDER to Go To Small Claims Courtyourself, make three copies of the Claim and Order to Go to Small Claims Court, so that you have a total of four: one for the Court, one for you, one to be served on your landlord, and one extra.Go to the &ldquo;Small Claims&rdquo; filing window of the courthouse identified on the first page of the Claim and Order to Go to Small Claims Court.&nbsp; Give the original and signed copies of your Claim and Order to Go to Small Claims Court to the clerk and pay the required fee ($30.00 if the claim is for $1,500.00 or less, $50.00 if the claim is for more than $1,500.00 but up to $5,000.00, and $75.00 if the claim is for more than $5,000.00).&nbsp; Once filed, the clerk will issue a trial date and stamp the date on the Claim and Order to Go to Small Claims Court.</p>
<p><strong>Hiring a Vendor.</strong>You actually do not need to file the Claim and Order to Go to Small Claims Court yourself.&nbsp; Someone can do this for you.&nbsp; Several companies offer this service, including but not limited to <a href="http://ezsmallclaims.net">EZ Small Claims</a>,<a href="https://www.servesrus.com/">Serves R Us</a>, <a href="https://www.attorneyscertified.com/">Attorney&rsquo;s Certified Services</a>, <a href="http://www.served-u.com/">S &amp; R Services</a>, and<a href="https://valproattorneyservices.com/" aria-invalid="true">Valpro Attorney Services</a>While Security Deposit Toolkit, Inc. is not in any way affiliated with these vendors, we mention them specifically because all currently hold A+ ratings with the Better Business Bureau..These companies offer a range of services from the filing of a Claim and Order to Go to Small Claims Court to serving of a Claim and Order to Go to Small Claims Court.&nbsp; Some even offeradditional small claims help. All five companies offer service in all counties of California, but some do not offer court filing in all counties. &nbsp;When selecting a vendor, be sure the company offers filing and/or process server services in the county in which you are filing your Claim and Order to Go to Small Claims Court.&nbsp; Attorney&rsquo;s Certified Services also offers service outside of the state of California if needed. When researching other potential vendors, be sure to check third party review sites (e.g., the <a href="https://www.bbb.org/">Better Business Bureau</a> website). More information on serving your Claim and Order to Go to Small Claims Court is listed in the next section.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>C. &nbsp; Arranging for Service of Plaintiff&rsquo;s Claim and ORDER to Go To Small Claims Court</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>California law requires that defendants in any legal action be served to ensure they are properly notified of the lawsuit filed against them.&nbsp; A process server (or &ldquo;server&rdquo;) is the person who delivers these documents.&nbsp; He or she must be at least eighteen years of age and not a party to the case.&nbsp; In other words, you cannot serve the Claim and Order to Go to Small Claims Court yourself.&nbsp; The server can be either a friend, relative, or co-worker; or, as noted in Section III(B), supra, you can hire a professional process server. There are three different ways to serve a defendant with a Claim and Order to Go to Small Claims Court in a small claims case: (1) via Certified Mail by the Court Clerk, (2) via personal service, and (3) via substituted service<strong>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Certified Mail by the Court Clerk.</strong> The easiest and least expensive way to serve your landlord with the Claim and Order to Go to Small Claims Court is via the court clerk, who is legally authorized to send it via certified mail and restricted delivery.&nbsp; You will have to pay a fee for every defendant.&nbsp; To learn more about fees, ask the clerk.&nbsp; The court clerk will get a return receipt that says that the defendant signed for the certified mail.&nbsp; Ten to fifteen days after the clerk mails the Claim and Order to Go to Small Claims Court, either check the court website or call the clerk&rsquo;s office to find out if it has been served.&nbsp; Provide the case number and hearing date when you ask for this information.&nbsp; If service by Certified Mail was unsuccessful, you must attempt either personal service or substituted service.</p>
<p><strong>Personal Service.</strong>Ask your server to personally &ldquo;serve&rdquo; (give) a copy of the Claim and Order to Go to Small Claims Court to your landlord or to the agent legally authorized to accept court papers for your landlord.&nbsp; Tell the server to walk up to your landlord at a home or work address; say, &ldquo;these are court papers&rdquo;; and give the person copies of all the court papers.&nbsp; If your landlord will not take the papers, the server can leave them near your landlord.&nbsp; It does not matter if your landlord tears them up or throws them away.&nbsp; The server must then fill out the Proof of Service (Small Claims) (<a href="http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/sc104.pdf">Form SC-104</a>), sign Page 2, and return the form to you for you to file.</p>
<p>You must serve your landlord via personal service at least 15 days before the court date (or 20 days if the person, business, or public entity you are serving is outside the county).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Substituted Service.</strong>If your landlord is not at home or work when your server goes there, your server can give the court papers to a competent adult (at</p>
<p>least eighteen years of age) living at your landlord&rsquo;s home; an adult who seems to be in charge where your landlord usually works; or an adult who seems to be in charge where your landlord receives mail.&nbsp; The server must also tell the person he or she is leaving the court papers with to give them to your landlord and write down the name of the person he or she gave the court papers to.&nbsp; If the person will not give his or her name, your server must write down a physical description of the person who took the papers.&nbsp; You must then mail another copy of the court papers by USPS First Class mail to your landlord at the same address where your server left the papers.&nbsp; The server MUST fill out and sign the Proof of Service (Small Claims) (<a href="http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/sc104.pdf">Form SC-104</a>) and the Proof of Mailing (Substituted Service) (<a href="http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/sc104a.pdf">Form SC-104A</a>).&nbsp; Once the server fills out both forms, he or she must return the completed forms for you to file with the clerk.</p>
<p>You must serve your landlord via substituted service at least 25 days before your court date (or 30 days if the person, business, or public entity you are serving is outside the county).&nbsp; See Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect;&sect; 116.340(b); 415.20(a).</p>
<p>If you are unable to serve your landlord via Certified Mail by the Court Clerk; via personal service at least 15 days before the court date (or 20 days if the person, business, or public entity you are serving is outside the county); or via substituted service at least 25 days before your court date (or 30 days if the person, business, or public entity you are serving is outside the county), your trial cannot proceed.&nbsp; In this case, you will need to postpone your trial date.&nbsp; To do so, complete Form SC-150, entitled &ldquo;Request to Postpone Trial.&rdquo;&nbsp; Included in this Security Deposit Toolkit as Exhibit E is a sample Request to Postpone Trial you can use as a template.</p>
<p>Further information on serving the defendant is available at <a href="http://www.courts.ca.gov/9742.htm">http://www.courts.ca.gov/9742.htm</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>D.&nbsp; &nbsp; Filing a Proof of Service</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you successfully served your landlord via Certified Mail by the Court Clerk, you do not need to file any proof of service.If your landlord was served personally, the server must fill out the Proof of Service (Small Claims) (<a href="http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/sc104.pdf">Form SC-104</a>), sign Page 2, and either file it or return it to you to file.&nbsp; If your landlord was served via substitute service, the server must fill out and sign the Proof of Service (Small Claims) (<a href="http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/sc104.pdf">Form SC-104</a>) and the Proof of Mailing (Substituted Service) (<a href="http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/sc104a.pdf">Form SC-104A</a>), and return the forms to you to file.</p>
<p>Before you file the Form SC-104 (if your landlord was personally served) or Forms SC-104 and SC-104A (if your landlord was substitute served), make at least three copies.&nbsp; As with the Claim and Order to Go to Small Claims Court, you actually do not need to file these documents yourself.&nbsp; Someone can do this for you, as noted in Section III(B), supra.&nbsp; You or someone acting on your behalf should go to the &ldquo;Small Claims&rdquo; filing window of the courthouse identified on the first page of the Claim and Order to Go to Small Claims Court, present the document, and receive stamped copies.&nbsp; There should be no charge for this.&nbsp; While it is possible to file by mail, we do not recommend this given what is typically a small window between the date the Claim and Order to Go to Small Claims Court is filed and the deadline file the proof of service.&nbsp; You must file Form SC-104 (if your landlord was personally served) or Forms SC-104 and SC-104A (if your landlord was substitute served) with the court at least five days before your Small Claims trial date.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>E.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Preparing for Trial</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the plaintiff, you have the burden of proving your claim by the &ldquo;more likely than not&rdquo; standard (think 50.0001%).</p>
<p>Three items will be especially critical to proving your claim.&nbsp; The first is a factual summary of the events that led you to court, organized chronologically and not exceeding one page.&nbsp; (Included in this Security Deposit Toolkit as Exhibit F is a sample factual summary/timeline you can use as a template.)&nbsp; The second is the law pertaining to security deposits, California Civil Code section 1950.5 (available <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=CIV&amp;sectionNum=1950.5">here</a> or at the end of this Security Deposit Toolkit) and any other local ordinances relating to security deposits (e.g., San Francisco Administrative Code section 49.2(a)&ndash;(g), also available at the end of this Security Deposit Toolkit).&nbsp; Although the Small Claims Court judge will probably have heard many other&nbsp;security deposit disputes and will probably already be very familiar with the law, it is still a good idea to have the law with you for reference.&nbsp; The third is a spreadsheet or other document calculating how you arrived at the number in your Claim and Order to Go to Small Claims Court, and all supporting evidence.&nbsp; (Again, included in this Security Deposit Toolkit as Exhibit D is a Security Deposit Expense Calculator.)&nbsp; Finally, you should also bring with you a copy your Claim and Order to Go to Small Claims Court and any proofs of service.</p>
<p>Included in this Security Deposit Toolkit as Exhibit G is a sample checklist of the above-referenced categories of documents to bring with you to your Small Claims Court trial.&nbsp; These include the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Factual summary/timeline;</li>
<li>California Civil Code section 1950.5 (available <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=CIV&amp;sectionNum=1950.5">here</a> or at the end of this Security Deposit Toolkit) <a name="_Hlk528207773"></a>and any local ordinance authorizing interest to be paid on your security deposit;</li>
<li>Your Security Deposit Expense Calculator, showing the total amount due;</li>
<li>All supporting evidence, including:
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li>Your original lease;</li>
<li>Any written communications (e.g., emails, texts, letters, and faxes) between you and your landlord demonstrating that he/she/it retained all or part of your security deposit in bad faith;</li>
<li>If applicable, your move out letter, and proof of mailing and/or emailing;</li>
<li>If applicable, any photos of your former rental unit at the time of the initial inspection and/or move out.</li>
<li>If applicable, the itemized list your landlord provided after the initial inspection.</li>
<li>Your security deposit demand letter, and proof of mailing and/or emailing;</li>
<li>Receipts for any expenses for which you are seeking reimbursement (e.g., for process server charges, court filing fees, etc.); and</li>
<li>Any other relevant documents.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>And all court documents, including:
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li>Plaintiff&rsquo;s Claim and ORDER to Go To Small Claims Court;</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If applicable, Form SC-104 (if your landlord was personally served) or Forms SC-104 and SC-104A (if your landlord was substitute served).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Prepare and assemble four identical sets the documents above: one for you, one for the landlord, one for the judge, and one extra copy.&nbsp; Put all of these documents into an organized folder.&nbsp; The easier you make it for yourself to present your story and for the judge to understand it, the better your odds of prevailing at trial.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Although the documentary evidence will be most important to proving your claim, testimonial evidence is also very powerful.&nbsp; While most third parties generally prefer not to get involved in legal disputes, you may wish to ask a roommate or other person present for the initial inspection to appear with you and testify about what he or she observed firsthand.&nbsp; Be sure to give any witnesses or other individuals planning on appearing with you a filed copy of the Claim and ORDER to Go To Small Claims Court, which includes the time, date, and location of your Small Claims Court trial.&nbsp; Remind these individuals to arrive early.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Since court caseloads vary from county to county and it is impossible to know how busy the court will be on any given day, plan on the trial taking the entire day.&nbsp; In other words, do not plan on returning to work in the afternoon if you have a 10:00 a.m. trial date.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Get a good night&rsquo;s rest before your trial.&nbsp; Wear a suit to court.&nbsp; This will show the judge (and the defendant) you are taking this matter seriously.&nbsp; Find the location of the courthouse.&nbsp; If you plan to drive, ensure you know where to park.&nbsp; If you plan to take public transportation, know where and when you will be dropped off.&nbsp; Plan on arriving at the courtroom at least thirty minutes before your trial.&nbsp; Since it could take up to half an hour to wait in line and get through security, plan on physically entering the courthouse at least one hour before your trial.&nbsp; You do not want to be rushed on your trial date.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Further information on preparing for trial is available at <a href="http://www.courts.ca.gov/1013.htm">http://www.courts.ca.gov/1013.htm</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>F.&nbsp; Attending Trial</strong></p>
<p>After entering the courthouse (and, if applicable, coordinating with any other witnesses or individuals), head to your assigned courtroom.&nbsp; This will be listed on the Claim and Order to Go to Small Claims Court.&nbsp; You will likely find many other litigants waiting outside.</p>
<p>Most courts will have a calendar placed directly outside of the courtroom with a list of the cases the judge will hear that day.&nbsp; Note the line number associated with your lawsuit.&nbsp; Once the doors open, check in with the clerk.&nbsp; The clerk will ask which line you are on and whether you are the plaintiff or the defendant.&nbsp; After you check in, take a seat and wait for your matter to be called.</p>
<p>The clerk will likely go over some of the rules of the court and, assuming both sides are present, may ask you both to step outside and share your evidence with each other.&nbsp; After you have done so, enter the courtroom and wait until your case is called.</p>
<p>When it is, approach the table in front of the judge.&nbsp; The plaintiff usually sits or stands on the left-hand side but go wherever you are instructed.&nbsp; The judge may ask the parties if they want to attempt mediation or order the parties to attempt mediation.&nbsp; Mediation, a form of alternative dispute resolution, is always a good idea.&nbsp; Because it is nonbinding, nothing bad can happen: either your case settles or it does not.&nbsp; Courts often have onsite neutral mediators (usually experienced attorneys) to assist litigants free of charge.&nbsp; If you come to an agreement at mediation, you do not need to present your case to the judge.&nbsp; The mediator can assist in memorializing the terms of any agreement and then present it to the judge.&nbsp; The judge will then (1) enter it into the record and (2) set a &ldquo;compliance hearing&rdquo; at a later date so that if the defendant fails to comply with the agreement, you can return to court and request an immediate judgment.&nbsp; If you do not come to an agreement at mediation, you can simply return to the court to present your case.</p>
<p>As the plaintiff, you will go first. As noted, you have the burden of proving your case.&nbsp; Relying on the documents you prepared, succinctly explain your case to the judge.&nbsp; Always be respectful; never interrupt the judge or the landlord.&nbsp; Your landlord will have a chance to present his or her side and challenge any evidence you may present with his or her own.&nbsp; In most cases, the judge will take the matter &ldquo;under submission,&rdquo; i.e., return to his or her chambers to review all the evidence and arguments presented and issue a written decision later.&nbsp; Usually, a decision will be mailed to the parties within two to four weeks of the trial date.</p>

                'title' => '<strong>IV.	Enforcing Your Judgment</strong>',
                'description' => '<p>Assuming the Court issues a judgment in your favor, the final step in this process is actually collecting your security deposit from the landlord.The Court may order the judgment to be satisfied (paid) by a particular date.&nbsp; If this is the case, take no action until after this date.&nbsp; Once the landlord pays the judgment, immediately complete and arrange for the filing of an Acknowledgment of Satisfaction of Judgment (<a href="https://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/sc290.pdf">Form SC-290</a>).&nbsp;<strong> If an Abstract of Judgment has been filed, use <a href="https://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/sc130.pdf">Form SC-130</a>.&nbsp; If you fail to timely file an Acknowledgment of Satisfaction of Judgment, you may be fined!</strong></p>
<p>Keep in mind a judgment is just a piece of paper that your landlord may simply choose to ignore.&nbsp; If he or she does, you will need to enforce your judgment.</p>
<p>While various legal remedies exist to enforce judgments (e.g., a judgment lien on real property, a judgment lien on personal property, enforcement of judgment by writ of execution, and wage garnishment), these remedies are complicated, require the expertise of an attorney, and are likely cost-prohibitive based on the amount you likely recovered.</p>
<p>Because a letter is a low-cost alternative to hiring an attorney, sending a letter to your landlord informing him or her of your rights and intentions may compel him or her to comply with the judgment.&nbsp; Included in this Security Deposit Toolkit as Exhibit H is a document entitled &ldquo;Sample Post-Judgment Letter to Landlord.&rdquo;&nbsp; This letter informs your landlord that if he or she does not satisfy the judgment by a date within the next two weeks, you reserve the right to use the legal means available to you to enforce the judgment, including sending the judgment to collections. &nbsp;You also reserve the right to report your experience to the Better Business Bureau and/or post a review of your experience on one or more social media platforms.&nbsp; (Be sure to confirm the presence of your landlord on at least one social media platform before you include any such statement.&nbsp; A property management company or professional landlord is more likely to have a social media presence than an individual.)</p>
<p>Once the letter has been finalized, print it, sign it, scan it, and mail it via USPS Certified Mail (or another courier with a tracking option) to the landlord address identified in the Claim and Order to Go to Small Claims Court.</p>
<p>If you have the landlord&rsquo;s email address, email a digital copy of the scanned letter to your landlord.&nbsp; In the subject line, enter &ldquo;<strong>Your Full Name</strong> v. <strong>Landlord&rsquo;s Full Name</strong>, <strong>County Name</strong> County Superior Court Case No. <strong>Case Number</strong>&rdquo; and in the body, enter &ldquo;<strong>Dear Mr./Ms. Landlord</strong>, Find attached correspondence regarding payment of the judgment in the above-referenced matter.&nbsp; Regards, <strong>Your Name</strong>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Feel free to customize the language and tone of the message.&nbsp; What is most important is that the letter is attached.&nbsp; If your email software has this feature, request a send receipt and a read receipt, which would prove that your message was sent and read, respectively.&nbsp; Your landlord may elect not to indicate whether the message was read, which is why you are also mailing a copy of the letter.</p>
<p>Once the deadline in your letter has passed, do what you promised.&nbsp; To file a report with the Better Business Bureau, visit <a href="https://www.bbb.org/consumer-complaints/file-a-complaint/get-started">https://www.bbb.org/consumer-complaints/file-a-complaint/get-started</a>.&nbsp; To post a review on a social media platform such as Yelp!, Google, or Facebook, visit these sites and search for your landlord.</p>
<p>If you so desire, you can send the matter to a collections company or debt collector.&nbsp; Be sure to investigate any potential collections companies or debt collectors to ensure they are reputable and have a successful track record.</p>'
